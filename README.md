- **Project name:** DA2324_PRJ2_G13_4
- **Short description:** The goal of this assignment is twofold. First, implement a basic exhaustive approach for the
classic routing problem using the TSP abstraction, therefore learning first-hand that although
such an approach can find optimal solutions, its applicability is restricted to very small graphs.
Second, refine your critical thinking skills, by developing and analysing a set of approximate
solutions to the TSP. This project designs efficient algorithms to find optimal routes for vehicles in generic shipping and
delivery scenarios, from urban deliveries to ocean shipping. This problem corresponds to the TSP.
As the TSP is intractable, there are no known efficient algorithms to solve it.
Backtracking techniques can find the optimal solution to this problem.
If the graph is small, the application of these approaches might be reasonable.
However their application to large graphs is infeasible, due to their high computational complexity.
